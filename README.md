Training data to make predictions for Crypto Investments

## Background
The popularity of bitcoin has caused a price jump that makes it unavailable for most investors. There are many other cryptocurrencies that are much more affordable. To sort through the mass of options out there I will use Machine Learning to make informed investment choices. 

Before I begin,  I consider the following questions:
* What knowledge do we hope to glean from running an unsupervised learning model on this dataset?
* What data is available? What type? What is missing? What can be removed?
* Is the data in a format that can be passed into an unsupervised learning model?
* Can I quickly hand off this data for others to use?
* What is the best way to cluster the data?
* What is the best way to visualize my results. 

In order to complete this project, I am performing unsupervised machine learning functions on data provided CryptoCompare. 


## Results


## Visualizing Cryptocurrencies
3D scatter plot using Plotly Express to plot the clusters. We were able to identify 4 Clusters as determined by the elbow curve.
